; Exercise 3.24.  In the table implementations above, the keys are tested for equality 
; using equal? (called by assoc). This is not always the appropriate test. For instance,
;  we might have a table with numeric keys in which we don't need an exact match to the
; number we're looking up, but only a number within some tolerance of it. Design a table
;  constructor make-table that takes as an argument a same-key? procedure that will be
;  used to test ``equality'' of keys. Make-table should return a dispatch procedure that
; can be used to access appropriate lookup and insert! procedures for a local table.


(define (make-table same-key?)
  (let ((local-table (list '*table*)) (assoc '()))
    (define (assoc var li);All we need to do is redefine assoc using the same-key? procedure provided by the user
      (cond ((null? li) #f)
            ((same-key? key (caar li)) (car li))
            (else (assoc var (cdr li)))))
    (define (lookup key-1 key-2)
      (let ((subtable (assoc key-1 (cdr local-table))))
        (if subtable
            (let ((record (assoc key-2 (cdr subtable))))
              (if record
                  (cdr record)
                  false))
            false)))
    (define (insert! key-1 key-2 value)
      (let ((subtable (assoc key-1 (cdr local-table))))
