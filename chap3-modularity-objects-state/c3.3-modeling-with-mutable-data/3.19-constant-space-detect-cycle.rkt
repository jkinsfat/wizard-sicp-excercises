; Exercise 3.19.  Redo exercise 3.18 using an algorithm that takes only a constant
;  amount of space. (This requires a very clever idea.)

; I need to wait to get in a clever head space
; perhaps by shoving each car and cdr into a list and pushing their children in after them.
; That way we can just keep iterating through the list instead of making two calls at the end
; of the helper procedure.
