; Exercise 2.21.  The procedure square-list takes a list of numbers as argument and returns a list of the squares of those numbers.

; (square-list (list 1 2 3 4))
; (1 4 9 16)

; Here are two different definitions of square-list. Complete both of them by filling in the missing expressions:

; (define (square-list items)
;   (if (null? items)
;       nil
;       (cons <??> <??>)))
; (define (square-list items)
;   (map <??> <??>))

(define (map proc list)
  (if (null? list)
    '()
    (cons ((proc (car list))
           (map proc (cdr list))))))

(define (square-list items)
  (if (null? items)
    '()
    (cons (expt items 2) (square-list (cdr items)))))

(define (square-list items)
  (map (lambda (x) (expt x 2)) items))
